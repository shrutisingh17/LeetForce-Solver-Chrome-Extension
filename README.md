LeetForce - The Ultimate LeetCode Discipline Enforcer



🚀 Introduction

LeetForce is a Chrome extension designed to force users to solve LeetCode problems before they can navigate away. If you struggle with procrastination or frequently abandon problems before solving them, LeetForce ensures you stay focused and accountable.

🎯 Features

✅ Forced Problem Solving - You cannot leave the page until you solve the problem.

✅ Auto-fetch Next Problem - Once solved, LeetForce fetches a new problem based on your selected difficulty and topics.

✅ Difficulty & Topic Filters - Choose your preferred problem difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard) and specific topics.

✅ Tab Switch Prevention - Prevents you from switching tabs or closing the page until the problem is solved.

✅ Progress Tracker - Tracks the number of problems solved daily for consistency.

✅ Set Problem Limit - You can set the number of problems to solve in one go. Until you complete them, you cannot navigate away.

📌 How It Works
